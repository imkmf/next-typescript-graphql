# next-typescript-graphql

A simple [next.js](https://nextjs.org) template with support for TypeScript files, and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/).

This template was created for usage with [byteconf.com](https://byteconf.com) - it will get some updates as part of that process, but please feel free to contribute, too! In particular, I'm pretty new to the next.js ecosystem, so I'm very eager to receive recommendations on how best to format this project.

## Usage

Running the application: `yarn run dev`

Building the application: `yarn run build`

## Getting started

This template is designed to be workable with the next.js documentation - in particular, check out the [setup guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/#setup)! Just make sure to use `.tsx` instead of `.js` :sunglasses:
